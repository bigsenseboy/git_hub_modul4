    <p class="paragraph-4"> A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs.
        [1] Most programming languages are text-based formal languages, but they may
         also be graphical. They are a kind of computer language.

        The description of a programming language is usually split into the two comp
        onents of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), which are usually defined b
        y a formal language. Some languages are defined by a specification document 
        (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) wh
        ile other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is tr
        eated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic language defi
        ned by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation bein
        g common.
        
        Programming language theory is the subfield of computer science that studies 
        the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification o
        f programming languages.</p>
